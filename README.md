### Three game Screens with individual enemys
* First battle against a very simple Undead which deals 20 dmg each turn
![First-Game](readme-pics/first-game.png)
* Second battle is against a mimic which will cast any ability you do so to guarante victory you need to throw the Attack until you roll 31 dmg or more and then finish him off with spells and since he copys anything you do that means if you roll under 31 you can simpely heal and he will do the same
![Second-Game](readme-pics/second-game.png)
* Third battle is against the boss who has 150 hp and deals 25 dmg per turn so you can still out heal the dmg but it will take a while
![Third-Game](readme-pics/third-game.png)
### Two "End game" Screens
* Right after you beat the boss you get the first end screen
![End-First](readme-pics/first-end.png)
* Then after ten seconds you get the second end screen with the plot twist and the option to start over
